// setState is a function typically used in React components to update the component's state.
//  This process creates a shallow copy, meaning that the new object's properties reference the same values as the original object's properties. However, if the properties themselves are objects or arrays, they are not deeply copied; rather, their references are copied. This means that changes to nested objects or arrays within state after the spread operation will affect both the original state object and the copied object. However, if you want to update or add a property while preserving the existing state, you should use setState({ ...state, [anchor]: open }).
